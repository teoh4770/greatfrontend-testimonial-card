# Challenge 1: Testimonial Card Component

I complete this challenge to improve my foundation of HTML and CSS.

In this challenge, I focus on achieving:
- [X] Semantic & Accessible HTML
- [X] CSS that follow BEM methodology
- [X] Handle long strings in case the full name is too long

## üì¶ Technologies
- <code>Vite</code>
- <code>React.js</code>
- <code>TypeScript</code>
- <code>Tailwind CSS</code>

Honestly, I could just use normal HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript to complete this small, simple challenge.

üìö What I Learned
- Has a quick refresher on some of the semantic html component such as <code>figure</code>, <code>figurecaption</code> and <code>blockquote</code>.
- Has a quick refresher on BEM methodology.
